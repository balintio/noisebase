Benchmarks
==========

Noisebase maintains benchmarks between denoising methods tested on comparable test datasets.

:::{note}
We have very few results for now but will add more alongside per-pixel versions of our datasets, foreseeably in June.

:::{tip}
If you want to see your method's results here, [email me](mailto:martin@balint.io), and I'll add them right away! **Your code must be publicly available**.
